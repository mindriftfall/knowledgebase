Text generation pattern using LangChain

For text generation, you can also use a LangChain, an open source library, for specific text generation use cases. You can pair LangChain with the text generation FMs on Amazon Bedrock to support both text generation and to develop conversational, AI Assistants. 

LangChain acts as an orchestration layer between the prompt input request and the generated output from the Amazon Bedrock FM. The architecture pattern for text generation with LangChain is illustrated in the following diagram.
