Text generation pattern using LangChain

For text generation, you can also use a LangChain, an open source library, for specific text generation use cases. You can pair LangChain with the text generation FMs on Amazon Bedrock to support both text generation and to develop conversational, AI Assistants.

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by LLMs. LangChain provides the software building blocks to reduce the complexity of building functionality from scratch. LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle, including development, productionization, and deployment. You can use it to take full advantage of the power of the LLMs.

LangChain supports integration for Amazon Bedrock with the langchain.aws and langchain-community packages.  Amazon Bedrock currently supports Titan Text models from Amazon, Jurassic models from AI21, Claude from Anthropic, Cohere Command and Embed, Llama models from Meta, Stable Diffusion models from Stability AI, and Mistral models from Mistral AI.

LangChain acts as an orchestration layer between the prompt input request and the generated output from the Amazon Bedrock FM. The architecture pattern for text generation with LangChain is illustrated in the following diagram.
